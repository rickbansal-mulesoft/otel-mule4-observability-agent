==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|======================
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Connection a| <<config_connection, Connection>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | | *x*{nbsp}
| DISABLE all Tracing a| Boolean |  +++Enable/Disable all tracing in this application.  If disabled, all other configuration details will be ignored.+++ |  +++false+++ | {nbsp}
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  +++Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform will expire the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime will actually purge the instances when it sees it fit.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Service Name a| String |  +++Logical (unique) name for this application (e.g., shoppingcart, productAPI, ...).+++ |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Resource Attributes a| Array of <<attribute>> |  +++Optional attributes for this application defined as <key,value> pairs(e.g., service.namespace:com.mycompany, service.version:0.0.1, ...). Attributes provide context to a distributed trace which can help with correlations to proivde a clear view of what was involved when performance changes occur.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Trace Collector Endpoint a| String |  +++Traget URL to which the OTLP Exporter sends traces. Must be a URL with a scheme of either http or https based on the use of TLS.+++ |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Endpoint Certificate a| String |  +++The path to the file containing trusted certificates to use when verifying an OTLP trace server's TLS credentials. The file should contain one or more X.509 certificates in PEM format.+++ |  ++++++ | {nbsp}
| OTLP Transport Protocol a| Enumeration, one of:

** GRPC
** HTTP_PROTOBUF
** HTTP_JSON |  |  +++HTTP_PROTOBUF+++ | {nbsp}
| Compression Type a| Enumeration, one of:

** NONE
** GZIP |  |  +++NONE+++ | {nbsp}
| Max Queue Size a| String |  +++The maximum number of spans in the waiting queue. Any new spans are dropped once the queue is full.+++ |  +++2048+++ | {nbsp}
| Max Batch Export Size a| String |  +++The maximum number of spans to export in a single batch.+++ |  +++512+++ | {nbsp}
| Batch Export Delay Interval (millisec) a| String |  +++The delay interval in milliseconds between two consecutive batch exports.+++ |  +++5000+++ | {nbsp}
| Batch Export Timeout (millsec) a| String |  +++Maximum time (milliseconds) the OTLP exporter will wait for a batch to export before cancelling the export.+++ |  +++30000+++ | {nbsp}
| Trace Headers a| Array of <<header>> |  +++Key-value pairs separated by commas to pass as request headers on an OTLP trace.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Generate Message Processor Spans a| Boolean |  +++Generate Message Processor spans and them to the trace+++ |  +++true+++ | {nbsp}
| Message Processor Span Bypass a| Array of <<MuleComponent>> |  +++List of Message Processors to bypass when generating Message Processor spans.+++ |  | {nbsp}
